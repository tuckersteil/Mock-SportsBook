# Phase-2 Project 
My Phase-2 project is a mock sports book.  It entails a user logging in to an account, where the user can then place bets on various sporting events. 

# Functionality of App
1 - When the app initially loads, the user will be on the "Login" page, where they choose and set a username and password, then click the login button.
2 - After logging in, the user will be directed to the "Home" page, where there is a list of 3 different professional sports (Basketball, Baseball, Football).
3 - Once the user clicks on one of the above mentioned sports, it will route them to a page that displays the lines and odds for different games that are takng place for that specific sport. 
4 - The user can then click on one of the various different lines/odds, which will fill out the bet slip with the information about the bet they selected. 
5 - The user is then prompted to input their desired bet amount, for that specific bet. 
6 - After entering the bet amount, the user can click the "Place bet" button, which will officially submit the bet. 
7 - Once the bet has been submitted, the user can click the "Pending" tab at the top of the screen, to see a full list of all of the bets they have placed. 
8 - Lastly, the user can click the "Logout" button, which will log them out and renturn them to the intial login page. 

# Different Bet Type's
1 - Spread:
    Bookmakers set a spread with the hopes of getting equal action on both sides of a game. For example, the Colts are a -3 point favorite against the Texans. The -3 points is the spread. If you want to bet the Colts on the spread, it would mean the Colts need to win by at least three points for you to win the bet. Conversely, if you selected the Texans +3, it would mean the Texans can lose by no more than 3 points for you to win the bet. 

2 - MoneyLine:
    Bookmakers set a moneyline for each team, meaning you are betting on that team to simply win the game straight up, which are typically set at "+" money for the underdog or "-" money for the favorite. For example, if the Colts were playing the Texans and the odds for moneyline were: Colts -200 & Texans + 200. If you bet $100 on the Colts at -200, if they won the game you'd win $50 and if they lost you'd lose the $100. Conversely, if you bet $100 on the Texans at +200, if they won the game you'd win $200 and if they lost the game you'd lose the $100. 

3 - Over/Under
    Bookmakers set an over under for the game, which is the combined total points/score for both teams in the game.  For example, if the Colts are playing the Texans and the over/under was set at 42.5. If you bet on the over, the teams would have to score a combined 43 points for you to win the bet. Conversely, if you bet the under, the score would have to be under 42 points for you to win the bet.
